Description: Coloured boxes, for LaTeX examples and theorems, etc
 The package provides an environment for coloured and framed text
 boxes with a heading line. Optionally, such a box can be split in an
 upper and a lower part; thus the package may be used for the setting
 of LaTeX examples where one part of the box displays the source code
 and the other part shows the output. Another common use case is the
 setting of theorems. The package supports saving and reuse of source
 code and text parts.
